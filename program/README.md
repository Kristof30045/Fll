# 1. Planning
a.	What should the robot do?
For this we have designed different types of robots

Initially we wanted to build the robot from Arduino but unfortunately this was not feasible due to lack of experience and sensors so we built our robot from Lego spike kit


# 2. Building, Testing the Robot
a.	Based on the plan we built 2 spike robot constructions

b.	Before writing the competition program, we wrote test programs for the prototype robot

c.	Testing the Prototype
The prototypes were tested using various test programs:
- Gyroscope line tracking
- Gyroscope turning
- Obstacle avoidance with Gyroscope (Unfortunately this was not possible due to lack of camera)

# 3. Writing the competition program and developing the robot
a.	We started writing the free-running program first. The robot was unstable at the beginning so we had to develop it further and build it according to the program.

b.	Once the program was stable and could perform the parking task, we increased the speed of the robot to complete the task as quickly as possible

c.	Avoiding obstacles without a camera would have been very difficult and cumbersome. Therefore, we compromised that it would not avoid all obstacles but would go around them in an inner arc, thus completing the task much more safely
